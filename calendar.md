# Road Map
## Getting set up
  * Create an account with the p5 editor: https://editor.p5js.org
  * Open an additional browser tab with the p5 reference https://p5js.org/reference/

## A - Draw shapes to the canvas
  * Understand the canvas size and coordinate system
  * Explore a variety of shapes (and lines, time permitting)
  * Add color, stroke, lineWeight
  * Lab: Explore the line function (if not yet). Draw your own animal or plant using only shapes. Give it color with fill and stroke. keep it simple, maximum 10 shapes. Save your file (will be using it for next lesson)

## B - Create a custom function with parameters
  * Declare/define a function
  * Add parameters to the custom function
  * Use relative values rather than constant values (encapsulation)
  * Call the function in the sketch (for example: use mouse position to create a stamp)
  * Lab: Add a parameter to the function to control the size of the output

## C - Declaring and using variables (and Constants)
  * Add variables to the sketch by declaring at the top using the `let` keyword
  * change the variable using math operators + - * /
  * Explore strings vs numbers (floats and ints)
  * Console.log to see the value of the variable
  * text() to write it to screen at a given position
  * Lab:
  |const|[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)|
  |let |[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)|
  |string|[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)|
  |number|[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type)|

## D - Booleans and conditional statements
  * true/false (1's and 0's)
  * If/else if/else statements, aka conditionals
  * mouseClicked events, keyPressed events
  * Use the if/else to call a custom function based on mouse position
  * Lab: Create an applet that draws different shapes depending on keyPresses and mouse Positions (use custom functions)

## E - External media (images)
  * preLoad an image into the sketch
  * Displaying the image, altering size and position
  * Image filters and effects
  * Lab: build a collage of images

## F - Arrays
  * Declaring and using Arrays
  * Accessing the elements of the array using bracket notation
  * Selecting the last item and a random item from the array
  * Lab: Build a madlib that uses words stored in an array

## G - Loops (for loop / while loop)
  * Use a for loop to add a bunch of numbers into an array
  * Use a for loop to display each element in an array
  * Use the increment variable to access each array item
  Lab: build an array of values and display them to the screen

## H - Work Day
  * Loop and array practice day
  * Use an array to store mouse positions and display the last 100 using a loop
  * Use an array to draw a row of shapes or lines
  Lab:

## I - P5 transformation tools
  * Transformations using p5
  * Push() Pop()
  * Translate() and rotate()
  * Lab: create a graphical composition that incorporates rotating elements

## J -
  * loading video
  * Playing video
  * sketching on top of the video
  Lab:  



## Algorithms to try - Extra
* draw random circles within a specific rectangular region on the canvas
* create a bool that bounces off of the edges of the screen
* Create starts (or pixels) that fall from the top of the screen
* Explore recursion - a function that calls itself
* Create a random walker that moves around the screen autonomously
* Create a grid of shapes without using a for loop
* a nested For loop
