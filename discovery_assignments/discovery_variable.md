# DISCOVERY ASSIGNMENT 2: *Variable*  
*The purpose of this is to identify a variable and differentiate it from the items or qualities that it measures.*

```Choose an observable variable that can be measured and quantified. This is something you know will change over time (examples: number of dishes in the sink, number cars in the parking lot at Porterâ€™s). Give this variable a Java Script compliant name. Likewise, identify the thing (object or quality) that your variable quantifies.```

```Define a set period of time to observe/document the variable (example: between 1PM and 3PM). Can you perform any actions that have an effect on the variable? If yes, do so and document this change. If not, explain. Reflect on your findings.```

## Example:

**Describe the variable (the part that changes):** The number of cars in the parking lot

**Describe the article/item/quality that is being measured:** cars

**Name the variable (in a javascript compliant way):** carsInLot

**Describe the measure by which the variable changes:** Time

**Documentation method:** Time-table in my journal

**Actions that might affect the variable value (if any):** Parking my car in the lot or blocking the driveway

### Observations/documentation:

| Time: | Value: |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1PM | 5 |
| 1:15PM | 6 |
| 1:30PM | 6 |
| 1:45PM | 10 |
| 2PM | 9 |
