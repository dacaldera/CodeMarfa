# DISCOVERY ASSIGNMENT 3: *Conditional Statements*
*The purpose of this is to illustrate how a random sequence of numbers (generated form the roll of a die) can be interpreted using a set of rules (aka conditional statements).*

- Begin by rolling your die 10 times, record your results in a sequence. This list is your key of actions.

- Refer to the conditional statement for your instructions for each number on your list.

- All students will begin near the closest yucca in the field outside of the trailers. Use the conditional statements provided to determine your movements and gestures.

- When youâ€™ve completed your sequence, create your own set of 20 actions (write each action on a card). Trade them with a classmate and perform them like you did in step 3.

## Action List

<h2>

```
if(1){
  action = "Walk 45 steps in the direction of the sun. If you reach a barrier, walk around it and continue or turn around and walk the remaining steps in the opposite direction of the barrier."
} else if(2){
action = "Shout a random word loudly into the air X number of times while looking up at the sky. X is determined by the position of this action in your list."
} else if(3){
action = "Take a seat on the floor where you currently stand and face east. After a minute, turn and face south. After a minute, turn and face west. After a minute, turn and face north. Finally stand back up."
} else if(4){
action = "Look around you and wave at someone. Do not stop until they acknowledge you waving at them. Consider shouting their name if you think it will help."
} else if(5){
action = "Walk to the nearest fence post and strike a pose like the Marlboro man against it for a few minutes."
} else if(6){
action = "Look to the skies for a flying bird within your vicinity. If found, start your action list sequence from where you are currently standing. If no birds are found, continue with the list. Skip this step on the second time around."
} else if(7){
action = "Stomp your foot and then clap your hands loudly once. Repeat this sequence however many years old you are."
} else if(8){
action = "Walk directly in a straight line to the nearest person and give them a high five. Do not mention this step to them. Continue this list from your new location."
} else if(9){
action = "Walk to the water well and wash your hands with water from it."
} else if(10){
action = "Look around you for the nearest rock. Walk to it, pick it up and carry it with you for the remainder of this exercise."
} else if(11){
action = "Take a long walk to a point far from the trailers. Take a picture of yourself pointing at the trailers from this location."
} else if(12){
action = "Walk to the nearest Yucca plant and walk 360 degrees around it while looking at it."
} else if(13){
action = "If you are wearing a hat, take it off and toss it as high into the air as you can. Retrieve it from where it lands. If you are not wearing a hat, then loudly yell out a huge yeeehaaaw."
} else if(14){
action = "Look around you and collect 5 small bits of nature (pebble, leaf, twig, etc.). Take these with you, and drop one off at each of your next 5 locations. If any are left over by the end of the exercise, toss them back into nature."
} else if(15){
action = "Drag a stick in the dirt to make a mark on the ground starting from your current location until you reach your next destination."
} else if(16){
action = "Collect a variety of rocks around you and place them in a ring on the ground around where you currently stand"
} else if(17){
action = "Use a camera to take photos of your feet as you walk 10 steps in any direction. One photo for each step."
} else if(18){
action = "If you have water, give the nearest plant a drink. If not, walk to the water well, get some water, and give the nearest plant a drink from there."
} else if(19){
action = "If you have water, give the nearest plant a drink. If not, walk to the water well, get some water, and give the nearest plant a drink from there."
} else if (20){
action = "Wander aimlessly for a few minutes"
}
